# SOAP service using Spring Boot

Hi. In this repo I practiced with Java and Spring to create a simple SOAP service, based on XML.
JSON is not the only standard for sending and receiving data through web, and besides SOAP
has many advantages focused on enterprise enviroments.

So, in this repo It's just gonna be the backend. For sending petitions without
a web client you need to install an extension call "Wizdlr" (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wizdler)

Once you've cloned the repo, you have to visit the following link: http://localhost:8080/ws/usuario.wsdl

## Main aspect of the xsd file

When visiting the link, the browser's gonna load the SOAP schema, it's a set of
entities that are created in a .xsd file and then it's parsed into a .wsdl file showing
all the methods to handle request and responses.

When the page is loaded, you have to click the Wizdler extension and it's going to show five methods

The name of the methods aren't expressed in any java method or something like that, these are generated by
a suffix, a convention that the DefaultWsdl11Definition has built in along with the framework
to extract from the .xsd entities the name of these methods (https://docs.spring.io/spring-ws/sites/1.5/reference/html/server.html#server-automatic-wsdl-exposure)
What does this mean? it means that when building your entities, you must set their names with the following structure: 
{THE NAME OF YOUR ENTITY} + [Request/Response]
EXAMPLE:myFirstIdentityRequest - myFirstIdentityResponse

## getById Request

## getUsuarios Request

## getUsuarios Response

## saveUsuarios Request

## saveUsuarios Response

It's saved in the database aswell

## updateById Request

You must set in the id parameter the id from the current user saved in the database, not a new Id or
something else

And in the database, the first user has his data changed permanently

And that's everything, the most important pieces of code are commented and for a simple crud, things are not complicated.
Something that was difficult to me while doing this was about generating the classes through the .xsd
to java classes and viceversa. If you're reading the docs from spring to do your own SOAP project, I suggest you
to check your target folder in the project because thats where the files are generated, I didn't knew this and I
thought that something was wrong with my Maven configuration
